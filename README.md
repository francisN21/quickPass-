# 03 JavaScript: quickPass V1

## ABOUT
```
A great password generator for personal use and will keep on adding features because I really liked this project so I can really use it for myself.
It contains special characters, numbers and as a special it includes selected OLD SCHOOL EMOJIS so it can get applied to your personal usage. Can generate 8 - 128 Characters ONLY and for added security I created a 4 PASS Shuffling array for more unique end result and don't worry those  (｡◕‿‿◕｡) faces won't get scrambled up.

Old School emojis are taken from https://textfac.es/ ~(˘▾˘~) ♥‿♥ ♥‿♥ (~˘▾˘)~
Glad to help you get a badass password ̿ ̿ ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з=(•_•)=ε/̵͇̿̿/'̿'̿ ̿ pew pew pew!

Notes: You can comment out the console log so you can see how it shuffles every iteration I made. You can add more iterations if you want for more unique results! Have FUN!
